## I would like to Develop an AI tool designed to analyze a person's publicly available social media profile (e.g., X or Facebook) and generate a detailed timeline and personality analysis, now enhanced with a user-friendly graphical user interface (UI). The AI should be capable of the following: 1. Collecting links, videos, and images shared on the public profile (using web crawling, manual input, or browser-based methods). 2. Identifying instances where the person’s experiences, preferences, or identity are expressed (e.g., marking relevant videos or images). 3. Analyzing the collected data to infer details such as religious beliefs, food preferences, character traits, political beliefs, and writing style. 4. Making predictions about the person based on the analysis (noting that accuracy may vary). 5. Detecting potential fake profiles by comparing writing styles to known individuals (e.g., suggesting that one profile’s style mimics another’s). The tool should feature a graphical user interface (UI) with the following elements: • A clean, intuitive dashboard where users can input a social media profile URL (e.g., X or Facebook handle). • A progress indicator showing the status of data collection and analysis. • A visually appealing results page displaying the timeline and inferred traits (e.g., using charts, graphs, or categorized sections for beliefs, preferences, and predictions). • An option to highlight flagged content (e.g., videos or posts linked to specific traits) with clickable links or thumbnails. • A section for writing style analysis and fake profile detection, with a confidence score or visual comparison. • Export functionality to save the analysis as a PDF or text file. The AI should remain open-source and adaptable, supporting flexible data collection methods (web scraping, manual link input, or incognito browsing) while ensuring it processes only publicly available information. Provide a framework that balances robust functionality with an accessible and visually engaging UI, encouraging further development by others. The goal is to transform the terminal-based concept into an interactive, user-friendly application while preserving its analytical depth.

Here's a mapping of the code files to the project structure, so you know exactly where to copy each file:

| Source File | Destination in Project Structure |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `social-media-analyzer.py` | `app/core/analyzer.py` |
| `social-media-gui.py` | `app/desktop/app.py` |
| `social-media-api.py` | `app/web/app.py` |

For the artifacts I created:

1. **Core Analyzer Code**:
   - Source: `social-media-analyzer` artifact
   - Destination: `app/core/analyzer.py`

2. **Desktop GUI Code**:
   - Source: `social-media-gui` artifact
   - Destination: `app/desktop/app.py`

3. **Web API Code**:
   - Source: `social-media-api` artifact
   - Destination: `app/web/app.py`

4. **Architecture Diagram**:
   - This was an SVG visualization that you can save for documentation purposes
   - Optional destination: `docs/architecture.svg`

You'll need to make a few adjustments to the imports in these files to match the project structure. For example, in the desktop app, you'll need to change imports from direct imports to use the project structure (e.g., `from social_media_analyzer import SocialMediaAnalyzer` would become `from app.core.analyzer import SocialMediaAnalyzer`).

You'll also need to split some of the larger files into their component parts according to the project structure. For example:
- Extract the `DataCollector` class from `analyzer.py` into `app/core/data_collector.py`
- Extract the `ContentAnalyzer` class into `app/core/content_analyzer.py`
- Extract the `ProfileAuthenticityAnalyzer` class into `app/core/authenticity.py`
- Extract the `PredictionEngine` class into `app/core/prediction.py`

For the web application, you should split the routes into:
- API routes go to `app/web/routes/api.py`
- Web view routes go to `app/web/routes/views.py`
- The HTML templates go to their respective files in `app/web/templates/`
- CSS goes to `app/web/static/css/style.css`
- JavaScript goes to `app/web/static/js/main.js`

This will give you a well-organized, modular codebase that follows best practices for Python projects.
